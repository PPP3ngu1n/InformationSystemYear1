## User Needs

### User stories
TODO: Write brief user stories to explain how various actors would interact with the system to accomplish a goal.
    Express these in the form from agile development:- As a (role) I want (goal) so that (benefit).

// Owen //  

As a member of the public I would want to see the places of where the CCTV's are located so that I can provide locations to where CCTV could be placed, in specific areas that feel unsafe. In addition to this as a member of public i would like to know where the locations of CCTVs are placed so that I could have reassurance that I would have a safer journey.

As the app creators, I want to create a app that ensures safety to the members of the public so that it allows access to everyone on where CCTV's are. I also would like to make the app easily available and straight to the point so that anyone of any age can find it straightforward to use. 

As a Councillor I want to ensure the safey of the civillians so that there will be more visitors to the city. This could benefit other businesses as a safer city would bring in more customers.

As a Secuirty guard I want to make patrols effiecient and effective for the public so that I am able to effectively tackle crimes in more dangerous areas.

As police officers, i would want to use the app to know which areas do not have many CCTV cameras so that I could focus more on those areas to prevent more crimes from happening.

    Summarise these using the use-case template below.

| TODO: USE-CASE ID e.g. UC1, UC2, ... | TODO: USE-CASE NAME | 
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Description** | TODO: Goal to be achieved by use case and sources for requirement |
| **Actors** | TODO: List of actors involved in use case |
| **Assumptions** | TODO: Pre/post-conditions if any</td></tr>
| **Steps** | TODO: Interactions between actors and system necessary to achieve goal |
| **Variations** | TODO: OPTIONAL - Any variations in the steps of a use case |
| **Non-functional** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of non-functional requirements that the use case must meet. |
| **Issues** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of issues that remain to be resolved |

| Use Case 1 | Community Feedback | 
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Description** | Allowing residents to suggest locations on where they feel unsafe |
| **Actors** | Public Member and The App Creator |
| **Assumptions** | Assumes that everyone haves a way to access to a smart phone and computers </td></tr>
| **Steps** | Public Member uses an in-app feature to request some CCTV's at the given location |
| **Variations** | Feedback Submission requests can be done different ways, done by email, phone calls and websites aswell |
| **Non-functional** | The app should be usable by everyone and no limitations, Data Privacy and Protection |

| **Non-functional** | The app should be easy to use so that people all ages can use the app. |
| **Issues** | CCTVs are not everywhere so people can not make a route for anywhere across the city |
